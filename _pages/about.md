I'm currently a researcher in Professor [Lerrel Pinto](https://www.lerrelpinto.com/)'s group at NYU, where I work on zero-shot human-to-robot learning. You can follow my work [on X](https://x.com/vincentjliu).

I received my BA in Mathematics and MS in Computer Science from Stanford University, where I was advised by [Chris Manning](https://nlp.stanford.edu/~manning/). My MS Distinction in Research introduced new adversarial methods for speech generation, and I was invited to lecture on the topic for [CS 236G: Generative Adversarial Networks](https://cs236g.stanford.edu/).

Prior to NYU, I researched 3D world models at [CSM](https://3d.csm.ai). As an undergraduate, I worked at [Tesla Autopilot](https://www.tesla.com/autopilot) with [Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.ai/) and at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/) Applied AI. My earlier academic work spanned multi-task learning and self-supervised learning with professors [Tatsu Hashimoto](https://thashim.github.io/), [Noah Goodman](https://cocolab.stanford.edu/ndg), and [Andrew Ng](https://www.andrewng.org/).
