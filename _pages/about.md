I'm building [Mecha](https://www.mecha.company), a robotics company to scale robot learning from humans in the real world. In the process of proofing this, I recently first-authored foundational research on [zero-shot human-to-robot learning](https://egozero-robot.github.io/). I post about AI, robotics, and deep tech startups [on X](https://x.com/vincentjliu).

I received my BA in Mathematics and MS in Computer Science from Stanford University. My past work in AI has spanned theoretical and applied topics in 3D world models, self-driving, speech generation, multi-task learning, self-supervised learning, computer vision, reinforcement learning, and natural language processing.
